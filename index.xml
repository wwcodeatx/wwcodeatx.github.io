      <description>Women Who Code started as a community group in 2011 when a handful of technologists decided they wanted to change the industry experience for women engineers. Since then, it has become a global non-profit organization and the world’s largest and most active community dedicated to inspiring women to excel in technology careers. One city at a time, Women Who Code spread around the world, reaching more than 20 countries.
The Austin Network started with a Meetup hosted by a recent bootcamp graduate and has grown into a vibrant community with members in all phases of their technical careers.</description>
